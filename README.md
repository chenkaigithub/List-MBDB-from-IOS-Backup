# List-MBDB-from-IOS-Backup
Parse manifest.MBDB from backups generated by iTunes

The program was written in Swift version 2.2 for Mac OS X.
The development environment in the moment is Xcode 7.3.1 under OS X 10.11 El Capitan.

The file manifest.MBDB contains the information over other files which were located in the same directory. These files represent the contents of an iPhone resp. iPad device at any one time. Each backup has its one directory and the files in it are updated every time when the device is connected to the computer and is synchronized.

The  above information is only valid for versions of OSX until 10.11 aka El Capitan. The new macOS Sierra is using a similar but yet different conception ( with different subdirectories and a SQL database Manifest.db ). So the program is not usable any more with OSX versions higher than 10.11 ...

With the help of manifest.MBDB you can extract files which could not be recovered otherwise.

There is a python script which inspired me to this program
see <https://gist.github.com/aliou/4448630>

Writing this program I learned a lot about crypting and retrieving information.

Disclaimer: Use the program for what purpose you like, but hold in mind, that I will not be responsible for any harm it will cause to your hard- or software. Anyway, it is your own decision to use this piece of software and your own responsibility.
